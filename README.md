# Hi, I'm Srinivas Padma 👋 
### Senior Design Systems Architect | Bridge between Pixels & Production

I specialize in building **high-density Design Systems** for complex infrastructure—Storage, Hybrid Cloud, and AI. I don't just design components; I engineer scalable UI foundations.

---

## 🚀 5-Second TL;DR
* **The Specialty:** Architecting systems for "Information Heavy" dashboards (Cloud/Storage/AI).
* **Figma Mastery:** Advanced Token logic, Variable-driven themes, and Auto Layout 5.0.
* **Tech Stack:** Headless React (React Aria), Tailwind CSS, and JSON-based design tokens.
* **The Philosophy:** Logic-first components. Accessibility isn't a feature; it's the foundation.
